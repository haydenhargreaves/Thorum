  <h1>Global Project Naming Conventions</h1>

  <h3><code>structs</code></h3>

  Structs will be named in <strong>CAPS</strong>
  <br><br>

  Examples:
  <br><br>

  <code>ROW :: struct {}</code>
  <br>
  <code>EDITOR :: struct {}</code>
  <br><br>

  Struct <strong>properties</strong> will be named in <strong>snake_case</strong>. This is
  to follow in C's footsteps.
  <br><br>

  Example:
  <br><br>

  <code>ROW :: struct { len: int, render_len: int, }</code>
  <br>




  <h1>Procedure Naming Conventions</h1>

  Functionality will be broken into modules

  The module will determine specific rules for the naming convention.
  <br>
  But general rules are as follows:

  <code>module.module_action_target</code>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>examples:</h3>

  <code>row.row_insert_char</code>
  <br>
  <code>row.row_remove_char</code>
  <br>
  <code>editor.editor_save_file</code>
  <br>
  <code>editor.editor_quit_editor</code>
  <br>
  <code style="margin-right: 40px;">row.rows_insert_row</code>
  <em>NOTE: This one uses rows, for more info view the rows module naming convention</em>



  <h2>Module Specific Naming Conventions</h2>

  <h3><code>row</code></h3>

  This module contains functionality for the individual rows. In order to maintain code base
  readability and size, procedures in this module will be able to modify the row they are
  called with, as well as other rows. However, procedures that should modify <strong>every</strong>
  row will not be here.
  <br><br>

  To create a more readable code base, procedures that modify <strong>only a single row</strong>,
  the one provided in the parameters, the second module segment will remain as <code>row</code>.
  <br><br>

  Examples:
  <br><br>

  <code>row.row_insert_char</code>
  <br>
  <code>row.row_remove_char</code>
  <br>
  <code>row.row_insert_substr</code>
  <br>
  <code>row.row_remove_substr</code>
  <br><br>

  For procedures that modify <strong>more than one row</strong>, the second module segment will be altered to
  <code>rows</code>. Indicating that many rows will be modified. However, this does not
  mean many rows are passed into the procedures. This can be handled by the procedure itself,
  but the naming convention will apply regardless.
  <br><br>

  Examples:
  <br><br>

  <code>row.rows_insert_newline</code>
  <br>
  <code>row.rows_remove_row</code>

  <h3><code>editor</code></h3>

  This module contains functionality for the editor as a whole. It will serve as a sort of "wrapper" around
  most of the other functionality. The biggest difference in this module is that some procedures will not
  have a <strong>target</strong> and therefore procedures can omit the target in some cases. As an example,
  it would be silly to name a procedure <code>editor.editor_init_editor</code>. The final <em>editor</em>
  can be removed.
  <br><br>

  If can <em>usually</em> be inferred that when the <strong>target</strong> is omitted, that the target is the
  editor struct itself. However, this may not always be the case. It will be otherwise specified in the documentation
  if so.
  <br><br>

  Examples:
  <br><br>

  <code>editor.editor_init</code>
  <br>
  <code>editor.editor_destory</code>
  <br>
  <code>editor.editor_save_file</code>
  <br>
  <code>editor.editor_open_file</code>
  <br>
